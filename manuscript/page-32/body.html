<h1> About the authors:</h1>

<h3>A note from Paris: </h3>
<p> Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey! (And for being a part of ours!) You were given so many great pieces in your personality and part of your journey may be to give fuel and attention to those pieces in order to bubble up into the brightest you that you can be! </p>

<h3>A note from Luigi: </h3>
<p>Thank you for showing your support! Much like the apple in this story, Paris and I spent a lot of time growing and working to make this happen and we've come out the other side better versions of ourselves. We hope that this book can inspire you to be the best you that you were meant to be!</p>
